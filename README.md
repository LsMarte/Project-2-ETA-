# Project-2-ETA-
Project build in C++
Large cities often supply various modes of 
transportation to move people from one 
location to another. You will complete a 
C++ program that estimates the time 
between 2 destinations within the city via 
walking, taxis, and the monorail.

 The city has a grid-like street system. The center of the city is at (0, 0) with positive x 
values to the east and positive y values to the north of the center (negative values in the 
other directions). Locations are recorded at the nearest mile marker, giving the whole 
numbers you see below (e.g., -6,2). 
To travel between any 2 locations, one can simply travel east-west and north-south. This 
is called the Manhattan distance (as NYC also has a grid system). For example, the 
Manhattan distance to travel from (-6,2) to (4,-3) is |-6-4| + |2-(-3)| = 10 + 5 = 15 (|x| 
represents the absolute value). Note the separate east-west and north-south distances as 
those will be used individually in some cases. 
Besides walking, the city is served by 2 taxi stands (one operates during the daytime, one 
only at night). In addition, there is a monorail that runs east-west (both directions) 
through the vertical center of the city with stops every mile marker.
